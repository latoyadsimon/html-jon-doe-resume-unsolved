Figured out how to set the mailto and tel links to open apps. It needs to be set on the computer and then on the browser.
Open settings > Apps > Default Apps.
Mail for email, set mailto.
Phone Link for telephone, set tel.
Set both to google chrome.
In Google Chrome:
Click the 3 dots hamburger menu
Open settings.
Privacy and Security > Site Settings.
Open Additional permissions > protocol handlers
set them here.

***Bonus, from research I learned about voice.google.com that gives you a free online phone number that can be redirected to your personal phone number. I set tel to that. I set email to mail.google.com.
